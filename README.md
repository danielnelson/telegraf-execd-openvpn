OpenVPN Plugin for Telegraf execd input
---
![](https://github.com/danielnelson/telegraf-execd-plugins/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

This repository contains an template project for building a Telegraf plugin as
a standalone binary that can be ran using the [execd][] input plugin.

Following this method you can generate binary packages for plugins currently
written as a Telegraf built-in input plugin without modifying the plugin.  This
allows you to have an open PR against the Telegraf repository and in the
meantime produce binaries that will work with execd.

The code for the plugin is contained in another repository and referenced in
the `go.mod` file.

If you are interested in using this plugin to monitor OpenVPN, the state of
the plugin is pre-alpha and is not recommended for production use.

## Usage

- Download the [latest release package][releases] for your platform.

- Unpack the build to your system:
  ```sh
  mkdir /var/lib/telegraf
  chown telegraf:telegraf /var/lib/telegraf
  tar xf openvpn-linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /var/lib/telegraf
  ```

- Edit execd plugin configuration as needed:
  ```sh
  vi /var/lib/telegraf/openvpn-linux-amd64/openvpn.conf
  ```

- Add to `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` or into file in `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.d`
  ```toml
  [[inputs.execd]]
    command = ["/var/lib/telegraf/openvpn-linux-amd64/openvpn --config /var/lib/telegraf/openvpn-linux-amd64/openvpn.conf"]
    signal = "STDIN"
  ```

- Restart or reload Telegraf.

## Development

When updating the plugin the replace directive in `go.mod` will need updated.

Generally it is expected that no tag will exist and the plugin will reside in a branch.
```sh
go mod edit -replace github.com/influxdata/telegraf=github.com/danielnelson/telegraf@openvpn-input
go mod tidy
```

Packages are generated by a GitHub action whenever a new tag is pushed to the repository.
```sh
git tag v0.0.10
git push origin v0.0.10
```
